In the updated code, a Material Icon (plus icon) has been added to the "Add a Dish" button. The `react-native-vector-icons/MaterialIcons` library is imported to enable the use of the icon. The icon is added inside the `TouchableOpacity` for the "Add a Dish" button, where the `Icon` component is used with the `name="add"` prop to display the plus icon. The size and color of the icon are set to 24px and white, respectively. Additionally, the button's style has been adjusted to arrange the text and the icon horizontally using `flexDirection: 'row'` and `alignItems: 'center'` for proper alignment. A margin is added to the right of the button text and left of the icon to ensure proper spacing between them. These changes improve the visual appeal and usability of the "Add a Dish" button by clearly indicating its action with a recognizable icon.In the updated code, the key change is the modification of the displayed prices in the "Average Prices by Course" section. The currency symbol for the average price has been changed from "R" by updating the text inside the map function that renders the average prices. Additionally, the "Add a Dish" button remains unchanged, but its functionality and styling are retained. The code now displays prices in dollars instead of the original currency, ensuring that the app reflects the correct currency based on the intended context or region. These minor changes make the displayed information more relevant for a different geographic region or market.
